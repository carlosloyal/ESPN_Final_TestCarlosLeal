Create a hybrid (web / mobile) automation framework following the architectural andclean coding best practices.                            
Rules to follow:
1. Be sure to use Page Object Pattern, Assertions (you decide how to validate
each of the flows), and Parameters.
2. Avoid using implicit waits
3. Use a BDD approach for the implementation (Cucumber)
4. There should be different feature files for web and mobile modules
5. Appropriate tagging should be done in each scenario (Tags for unique identifiers,
tags to identify if it is web or mobile, tags associated with features, etc).
6. The architecture of the framework should be defined by yourself following the
best practices and design patterns. The following diagram may be used as a
starting point:
7. Create a new github repository to upload the project and use git best practices on
it: Multiple branches, multiple commits, gitignore
